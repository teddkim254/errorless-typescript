**Challenge**

As a final diversion/self-challenge, I loaded errorneous code in the code editor. 
   It contains several plump, juicy errors. 
   
See if I can use TypeScript to find them all!

**Solution**
I used *Type annotations* in both primitive and functions to make Typescript happy!

***Beautiful! Array types may seem like a monster topic, but now I have got it tamed.I  learned:***

- The type annotations
- What tuples are, and how to do their type annotations.
- How type inference works with arrays and tuples.
- How to use the rest and spread operators with TypeScript.

Arrays types are a crucial component of TypeScript, so great job!
